# Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDRP)

The **Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDRP)** is a centre-left party active in the Russian Federation, founded in **2024** under the leadership of **Hugo von Namsgrad**. It advances a synthesis of **social democracy**, **market socialism**, and **environmentalism**, positioning itself as the modern heir to Russia’s social-democratic labour tradition. In the **2024 legislative election**, the party won **70 seats** in the State Duma and entered government in coalition with **Yabloko**.

---

## Ideology and Policies

### Social democracy & market socialism
The RSDRP balances regulated markets with a **strong public sector** in strategic domains (heavy industry, energy, transport). Core to its programme is the **Five-Month Industrialisation Plan**: factory modernisation (notably **Smolensk**; legacy capacity in **Tver** reduced), expansion of national rail and logistics corridors, and long-term capital investment guided by public interest.

### Social welfare
The party’s social pillar emphasises **universal healthcare**, **free secondary and tertiary education**, and **indexed pensions**. It backs automatic **cost-of-living adjustments** for social transfers and **caps on utility rates**, aiming to reduce precarity while sustaining broad-based demand.

### Environmentalism
Environmental commitments include **legally binding conservation targets** (wetlands, forests, steppe), **polluter-pays** instruments, incentives for **renewables** and **reforestation**, and the designation of new protected areas (e.g., the **Volga Delta** reserve). Industrial policy and conservation are coordinated through phased timetables to minimise disruption to employment and output.

---

## Equality and Social Inclusion
The RSDRP treats equality as a **single, unified struggle** rooted in class solidarity — not as a set of discrete identity campaigns. It argues that quotas and group-specific carve-outs risk **replacing one hierarchy with another**, without addressing the material barriers that drive exclusion.

Accordingly, the party pursues **universal measures**: free education and healthcare, a strong welfare state, housing support, and broad access to universities so admissions hinge on **merit rather than wealth**. Anti-discrimination law applies **equally to all**, covering employment, education and public services; **hate-speech provisions** are general, not identity-segmented. **Marriage and family law** are **composition-blind**, ensuring full equality of treatment.

For disabilities, the RSDRP couples strict anti-discrimination rules with **retraining and reorientation** for workers who can no longer perform prior roles, and mandates **accessibility standards** across transport, buildings and digital services. Linguistically, **federal republics** may recognise and fund **regional/minority languages**, with service provision where communities are sizeable. The party’s approach is **evolutionary**: law and investment accompany **public education and civic dialogue** to shift norms over time and rebuild working-class cohesion that, in its critique, parts of the modern left have eroded by fragmenting struggles into competing identity silos.

---

## Organisation
The party is structured around a **National Congress**, a **National Council**, and an **Executive Committee**. Internal currents exist — **Socialist Left**, **Reformist Centre**, **Eco-Socialists**, **Trade-Union current**, **Youth & Students**, **Feminist wing** — but statutory rules emphasise **consensus** and **unity of action**. These tendencies surface most in debates where **green constraints** intersect with **industrial priorities**, with negotiated trade-offs rather than unilateral wins.

## History

### Formation as the Social Democratic Party (May 2024)
Following adoption of a new constitution on **9 May 2024**, centre-left organisers founded the **Social Democratic Party (SDP)** in Moscow, pledging a **Five-Month Industrialisation Plan** and a programme of social welfare and environmental stewardship.

### First legislative election & SDP–KPRF coalition (July 2024)
In its first election (July 2024), the SDP won **70 seats**; the **KPRF** secured **5**. The two formed a working coalition and launched **Phase I** of the industrial plan — heavy-industry upgrades in **Smolensk**, managed deindustrialisation in **Tver**, and new rail corridors.

### Second election & continued partnership (January 2025)
A snap election in **January 2025** produced a **30–30** split for SDP and KPRF. The coalition persisted while monetary and price-stability measures were advanced, alongside environmental levies and social-welfare expansion.

### Rebranding as the RSDRP (March 2025)
At the **third congress (15 March 2025)**, delegates renamed the party the **Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDRP)**, adopted **red and pink** as party colours, and codified lineage to the **1898** social-democratic labour movement.

### Split from KPRF; RSDRP–Yabloko coalition (June 2025)
Policy tensions culminated in a break with the KPRF. In fresh elections on **4 June 2025**, the RSDRP took **40%** and formed a governing alliance with **Yabloko (20%)**, consolidating a centre-left majority while continuing the industrial and social programme.

---

## Support Base & Electoral Profile
The RSDRP draws strength from **urban professionals**, **public-sector employees**, **trade-union constituencies**, and **younger voters** oriented toward climate action and social justice. It consolidated segments of the former **SDP**, **Yabloko**, and **KPRF** electorates, presenting itself as a stable centre-left vehicle with an industrial strategy.

Figures refer to the **2024–2025** electoral cycle; policy descriptions reflect **enduring programme planks** intended to minimise updates over time.
