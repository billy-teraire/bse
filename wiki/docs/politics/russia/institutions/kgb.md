# Committee for State Security

The **Committee for State Security** (Russian: *Комитет государственной безопасности*), commonly known as the **KGB**, is the main intelligence and security agency of the Russian Federation. Re-established in **May 2025** by executive order of the Prime Minister, it consolidated the fragmented successor organisations of the Soviet-era KGB — including the **FSB**, **SVR**, and elements of the **FSO** and **GRU** — into a single, centralised body.

The reconstitution was justified as a response to mounting security concerns and recent crises, which exposed inefficiencies in coordination between existing agencies. The restored KGB is tasked with foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, counter-terrorism, and the protection of state leadership and infrastructure.

## History

### Re-establishment (2025)

On **20 May 2025**, Prime Minister Hugo von Namsgrad issued an executive order dissolving the main post-Soviet security services and merging them into a unified Committee for State Security. The decree cited “grave concerns for the security of the state” and the need for a “clear chain of command” in matters of intelligence and counterintelligence.

This move effectively reversed the 1991 split of the original Soviet KGB, which had been broken into separate agencies to limit its power. By 2025, however, the fragmented system was seen as a liability rather than a safeguard.

### Continuity and symbolism

The revived KGB adopted the **historic sword-and-shield emblem** of its Soviet predecessor, presenting itself as a guardian of the state’s continuity. While formally a new institution, it consciously frames itself as the heir to the traditions of state security.

## Organisation and Role

The KGB operates under the authority of the **Prime Minister** and reports to the **Supreme Soviet’s security oversight committee**. Its structure is not public, but it is believed to comprise departments for foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, communications security, and leadership protection.

Unlike its Soviet forebear, the modern KGB maintains a **low public profile**. Its activities are largely invisible to ordinary citizens, who are aware of its existence but rarely encounter it directly.

---

## Public perception

The agency is regarded with a mix of **awe and distance**. To most Russians, the KGB is a discreet instrument of statecraft rather than a daily presence. It is rarely the subject of open controversy, but its reconstitution raised quiet concerns among liberals about the concentration of power. For conservatives and nationalists, however, the move was seen as restoring efficiency and decisiveness to Russia’s security apparatus.
