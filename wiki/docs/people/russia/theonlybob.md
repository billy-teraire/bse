# The0nlyBob

**The0nlyBob** (Russian: *Зе0нлиБоб*) is a **Belarusian–Russian communist politician**. He is the **Chairman of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (KPRF)** since April 2024, a **member of the Supreme Soviet** since July 2024, and, since May 2025, also serves as **Chairman of the Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union (SKP–KPSS)**.  

---

## Early political activity

The0nlyBob emerged in the political landscape of 2024 during the collapse of the **Rodina coalition** and the fragmentation of Russian politics. Rooted in communist activism, he quickly established himself as a leading figure within the KPRF, guiding the party’s repositioning during the turbulent first year of the Federation.

---

## Leadership of the KPRF

Elected **Chairman of the KPRF** on **24 April 2024**, The0nlyBob became the party’s central organiser. Under his leadership, the KPRF participated in coalition governments and consistently advocated for stronger socialist provisions in the constitutional framework.  

He pushed for the **Leviy Povorot (Left Turn)** reforms and supported the **Five-Month Industrialisation Plan**, aligning closely with the Social Democrats while maintaining the KPRF’s more orthodox Marxist line.

---

## Parliamentary role

On **11 July 2024**, The0nlyBob entered the **Supreme Soviet** as a deputy. He quickly gained recognition for his rhetorical skill and his ability to rally support for left-wing legislative projects, including welfare expansion and industrial nationalisation. He played a role in the debates leading up to the attempted **September 2025 Constitution**, though the project ultimately failed after being struck down by the Supreme Court.

---

## Chairman of the SKP–KPSS

On **29 May 2025**, he assumed the **chairmanship of the SKP–KPSS**, symbolically linking the post-Soviet communist parties into a single transnational framework. This elevated his role beyond Russia, giving him influence in Belarus and other neighbouring states through the shared communist tradition.

---

## Political positions

* **Communism:** Advocates the continuation of the Soviet legacy, stressing state ownership of key industries.  
* **Integration:** Strong supporter of closer cooperation within the **CIS** and eventual socialist unification.  
* **Parliamentary socialism:** Promotes constitutional reform toward parliamentary supremacy with socialist guarantees.  

---

## Legacy and significance

Although relatively early in his career, The0nlyBob has become a **major figure in the post-Soviet left**, simultaneously leading the KPRF in Russia and the broader SKP–KPSS alliance. His dual role places him at the intersection of national politics in Moscow and transnational socialist cooperation across the former Soviet space.
