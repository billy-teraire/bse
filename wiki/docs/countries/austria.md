# Austria

The **Republic of Councils of Austria** or **Soviet Republic of Austria** is a landlocked country in Central Europe. Its capital and largest city is **Vienna**. Since June 2025, Austria has been ruled as a **one-party state** under the **Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ)**, which governs on a vanguardist model.

## Geography

Austria is situated in the Eastern Alps and along the Danube basin. Its landscape combines alpine highlands, rolling foothills, and fertile plains.  
The country has a **continental climate**, with cold winters, warm summers, and strong regional variation due to elevation. Vienna lies in the northeast, at the junction of historic trade and cultural routes across Central Europe.

## History

### Establishment of the Republic (2023)  
Austria was reconstituted on **11 June 2023** as a federal semi-presidential republic. Its first chancellor was **Phönix**, who oversaw the early phase of political reconstruction.

### The Leopold II episode (2024)  
On **11 November 2024**, **Leopold II of Habsburg** abruptly declared himself head of state, bypassing any election or parliamentary procedure. The following day, newspapers reported that the Austrian Chancellor had formally suspended the 1919 abolition of nobility. Shortly thereafter, Leopold was crowned Emperor of Austria in **St Stephen’s Cathedral**, Vienna.  

Subsequent investigations revealed that Leopold was acting as a **German agent**. According to the **KGB**, his mission was either to bring Austria into closer alignment with Germany or more likely to create conditions for a German intervention—potentially paving the way for an **Anschluss**. Once exposed, Leopold disappeared from public life and his brief reign came to an end.

### Communist coup (24 June 2025)  
On **24 June 2025**, the **Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ)**, led by **Michael Ferdinand**, staged a coup and established a **one-party Soviet republic**. This marked the transition from a federal republic to the *Räterepublik Österreich*.

### Centralisation of power (30 June 2025)  
On **30 June 2025**, Ferdinand announced the abolition of federalism and the full centralisation of authority in Vienna. The historic federal states were dissolved, with all power concentrated in the KPÖ headquarters and the national parliament.

## Government and Politics

Austria is formally governed through a **parliament**, but all seats are held by the **Communist Party of Austria (KPÖ)**. The **First Secretary of the KPÖ**, currently **Michael Ferdinand**, serves as the country’s de facto leader.  
The system is described as a **vanguardist one-party state**, with centralised political authority and no legal opposition.
