# Rodina

**Rodina** (Russian: *Родина*, “Homeland”) is a conservative political party in the Russian Federation that emerged from the breakup of the **Rodina Coalition** in 2024. It positions itself as a culturally traditional, nationally minded alternative to both the centre-left and the far-right, maintaining a modest federal presence while exercising executive authority in **Karelia**.

---

## Ideology
Rodina’s programme blends **cultural conservatism** with a **measured nationalism**. It emphasises family, faith, civic order and the preservation of Russian historical heritage. The party argues for a **strong but restrained state**: protective of sovereignty and public order, supportive of domestic producers, but sceptical of sweeping social-engineering projects or expansive welfare architectures.

Economically, Rodina favours **prudent economic nationalism**—limited protection for strategic industries, preference for local procurement, and targeted family support—over either laissez-faire liberalism or comprehensive state planning. It distinguishes itself from more **populist right-wing** formations by eschewing incendiary rhetoric and presenting a calmer, institutional conservative brand.

---

## Organisation
Rodina is structured around a **National Conference** (biennial), a **National Committee**, and an **Executive Council** that oversees daily operations. Following the departure of its founding chair in late 2024, the **leader’s post remains vacant**; an Executive Council chaired by a Secretary-General manages party affairs.

Policy work is handled by working groups on **security, social affairs, regional development and culture**, which draft platform planks for the National Committee. Regional branches operate across the federation, with the **Republic of Karelia** providing the party’s most significant base of power and a venue for implementing its conservative governance agenda.

---

## History

### Origins (2024)
The **Rodina Coalition**, a short-lived big-tent alliance, fractured in 2024. The conservative wing retained the **Rodina** name and formed an independent party, seeking to project continuity while distancing itself from the more strident tactics of the far-right **Avanguard**.

### Parliamentary debut (January 2025)
Rodina contested the **January 2025** snap election and obtained **five seats** in the State Duma. Its low-key campaign, focused on cultural continuity and local issues, attracted socially conservative voters disenchanted with both the governing centre-left and populist agitation on the right.

### Consolidation and regional foothold (June 2025)
At the **4 June 2025** election, Rodina maintained its **five-seat** delegation. National expansion proved difficult amid leadership uncertainty and competition from larger parties, but the party secured a major milestone with victory in the **Karelian presidential race**, giving Rodina an executive platform within the federal system.

### Present posture
Rodina functions as a **niche conservative formation** with limited federal reach but tangible regional authority. Its prospects centre on transforming the Karelian presidency into a model of conservative governance, resolving the leadership vacancy, and sharpening a policy profile that differentiates it from both the governing coalition and the radical right.
