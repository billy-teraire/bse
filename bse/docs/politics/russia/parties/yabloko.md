# Yabloko

**Yabloko** (Russian: *Яблоко*) is a liberal-centrist political party active across the post-Soviet sphere. Emerging from the collapse of the **Rodina Coalition** in 2024, Yabloko is the principal advocate of liberal democracy, rule of law, and pro-European alignment. It is led by **Kataroudy**, who also serves as the prime minister of Ukraine.

Yabloko dominates post-Soviet politics: it holds **majorities in the Ukrainian and Belarusian parliaments**, the **presidencies and governments of both states**, forms part of the **governing coalition in the RSFSR**, and commands a **plurality in the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS**, where it holds the presidency with RSDRP support. The party also maintains a presence in the **Supreme Council of the PMR**.

---

## Ideology

Yabloko promotes a platform of **liberal democracy, social liberalism, and European-style governance**.  

- **Rule of law:** Advocates constitutional stability, independent courts, and protection of civil liberties.  
- **Market orientation:** Supports a mixed economy with regulated private enterprise, while endorsing limited welfare programmes.  
- **Pro-European outlook:** Calls for alignment with European democratic standards and closer integration with Western economies.  
- **Social policy:** Defends minority rights, academic freedom, and a secular state.  
- **Foreign policy:** Promotes diplomacy, integration through the **CIS**, and engagement with European institutions.  

---

## Organisation

Yabloko is structured as a **parliamentary party** with strong regional branches across the CIS.  

- **National Congress:** Sets the party platform and ratifies leadership.  
- **Central Committee:** Handles day-to-day political operations and strategy.  
- **Regional branches:** Present in every CIS member and partner state, giving the party unprecedented reach across the post-Soviet world.  

The party’s image is reinforced by its **green apple logo**, symbolising renewal, moderation, and European democratic traditions.

## History

### Foundation (2024)

Yabloko was founded in 2024 as part of the fragmentation of the **Rodina Coalition**. The coalition’s collapse gave birth to multiple factions; Yabloko emerged as the liberal-centrist bloc under Kataroudy’s leadership.

### First Breakthrough (July 2024)

In the **July 2024 elections**, Yabloko secured approximately **40% of the vote**, becoming one of the two main parties in the Supreme Soviet. Although initially in opposition to the left, Yabloko demonstrated its willingness to form coalitions, positioning itself as the party of compromise and stability.

### Coalition Politics (2024–2025)

Yabloko participated in coalition governments during 2024–25, including a power-sharing arrangement after the collapse of Rodina. Following the **June 2025 elections**, Yabloko entered a governing coalition with the **Social Democrats (later RSDRP)**, moderating socialist economic reforms while upholding civil liberties and market liberalisation.

### Regional Expansion (2025)

By 2025, Yabloko had expanded beyond Russia:  
- In **Ukraine** and **Belarus**, it won parliamentary majorities and took the presidency in both states.  
- In the **CIS Interparliamentary Assembly**, Yabloko secured a plurality and the **Assembly presidency**, with RSDRP support.  
- In **Pridnestrovie**, Yabloko maintains deputies in the Supreme Council, shaping local policy from within.

## Public image

Yabloko’s reputation varies across the post-Soviet sphere.  

- **Supporters** see it as the guarantor of liberal democracy, moderation, and integration with Europe.  
- **Critics** portray it as an elitist, Westernised party, detached from rural and working-class concerns.  

Despite criticisms, Yabloko’s broad appeal to urban professionals, students, and reform-minded bureaucrats has made it the **most powerful and consistent force in post-Soviet politics** by 2025.
