# Communist Party of the Russian Federation

The **Communist Party of the Russian Federation** (Russian: *Коммунистическая партия Российской Федерации*), abbreviated **KPRF**, is a left-wing political party active in the Russian Federation. Founded in 2024, it positions itself as heir to Soviet-era traditions, advocating extensive public ownership, worker protections, and state-led development.

---

## Ideology

The KPRF promotes a platform of **state socialism** and economic sovereignty, arguing that only large-scale public ownership can ensure stability and social justice.

Key principles include:

* **Strategic public ownership:** Nationalisation of energy, heavy industry, transport and utilities, administered by state boards.
* **Workers’ rights:** Strengthened collective bargaining, workplace protections, and opposition to layoffs in key industries.
* **Welfare expansion:** Free and universal healthcare, education through university level, indexed pensions, and unemployment support.
* **Economic sovereignty:** Restricting foreign ownership of strategic sectors, reliance on state development banks and domestic capital.
* **Soviet legacy:** While not strictly Marxist-Leninist, the party draws heavily on Soviet nostalgia, framing itself as defender of social stability and equality.

## History

### Founding (2024)

The KPRF was created in May 2024 after Russia’s constitutional reforms, uniting veteran communists and younger left activists. It won **5 seats** in the **July 2024 election**, entering parliament as a minor but symbolically important force.

### Coalition with the SDP (2024–2025)

From July 2024 to June 2025, the KPRF partnered with the **Social Democratic Party (SDP)** in a left-wing governing coalition. Together they launched the **Five-Month Industrialisation Plan**, implemented price controls on essential goods, and expanded welfare guarantees.

In the **January 2025 election**, the SDP and KPRF each secured 30 seats, enabling their joint majority. This period marked the KPRF’s peak influence in shaping economic and industrial policy.

### Split and Opposition (June 2025–present)

The coalition collapsed ahead of the **4 June 2025 election**, when the SDP allied with **Yabloko** instead. The KPRF remained with **5 seats**, moving into opposition. Since then, it has acted as the **parliamentary left**, opposing privatisation, market reforms, and centrist coalitions, while promoting a return to stronger public ownership and worker-focused policies.

---

## Public Perception

The KPRF appeals strongly to **older generations** and citizens with nostalgia for the stability of the USSR. It remains respected as a symbolic guardian of Soviet traditions, though its small parliamentary share limits practical influence. Critics dismiss it as dependent on alliances with larger centre-left parties, while supporters credit it with keeping socialist ideals alive in Russia’s political system.
