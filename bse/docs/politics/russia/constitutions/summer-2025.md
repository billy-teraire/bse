# Summer 2025 Constitutional Debates

The **Summer 2025 Constitutional Debates** were a turning point in Russian politics, centred on the effort to replace the **9 May 2024 Constitution**. Running through June and July 2025, they exposed the fault lines between Russia’s main political forces and ended with the authorisation of a new socialist constitution — thanks not to new allies, but to the abstention of **Yabloko**, which allowed the motion to pass.

## Background

The **9 May 2024 Constitution** was drafted in the spirit of compromise during the brief **Rodina Coalition** government. Its provisions were deliberately broad to accommodate the disparate factions of the time, but in the end pleased none:

* The **left** had sought an explicitly socialist framework but were forced to concede under pressure at home and abroad.
* The **right** wanted a strong presidential system modelled on post-Yeltsin Russia.
* The **far right** demanded an authoritarian or even monarchist state.
* The **liberals** denounced the final text as incoherent.

Once the coalition collapsed and the **Social Democrats (later RSDRP)** came to dominate government, they set about amending the document. Key changes included:

* Abolition of *krai* and autonomous oblasts, standardising all units as oblasts (except republics).
* Expansion of social-welfare guarantees, including indexed transfers and free tertiary education.
* Enshrining parliamentary supremacy, reducing the President to a ceremonial role.
* Nationalisation of “strategic enterprises” in energy, heavy industry, and transport.

Despite these amendments, the RSDRP argued the structure of the 2024 Constitution still constrained deeper socialist transformation. By 2025, calls for a wholly new text had become central to their platform.

## Positions of the parties

* **RSDRP (Social Democrats):** Sought a new socialist constitution enshrining welfare guarantees, parliamentary authority, and state economic direction.
* **KPRF (Communists):** Supported replacement but wanted even stronger provisions on state ownership and planning.
* **Yabloko (Liberals):** Opposed socialist measures outright, but open to abstention in return for deregulation and lighter state economic controls.
* **Rodina (Conservatives):** Favoured protection of private property and rejected socialist constitutionalism.
* **LDPR:** Called for centralised nationalist authority, dismissing the debates as empty.

## Course of the debates

By mid-2025, the RSDRP concluded that left-wing votes alone were insufficient. Negotiations with Yabloko followed, centred on economic concessions.

The eventual compromise secured Yabloko’s **abstention** in the decisive vote — not support. In exchange, the government agreed to:

* Loosen state price controls in certain sectors.
* Permit greater use of public–private partnerships.
* Guarantee civil and political rights provisions would remain in the new draft.

The KPRF accepted these compromises reluctantly, viewing them as the price of advancing the constitutional project.

## Outcome

In late July 2025, the Supreme Soviet authorised the drafting of a **new socialist constitution**. The RSDRP and KPRF voted in favour, Rodina and the LDPR opposed, and Yabloko abstained — allowing the motion to pass.

This decision formally signalled the end of the **9 May 2024 Constitution**, clearing the way for the establishment of the **Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR)** as the successor state.
