# September Constitution of the RSFSR (2025)

The **September Constitution of the RSFSR** (Russian: *Конституция РСФСР*) was adopted on **16 September 2025** by the **Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic**. It replaced the 2024 Constitution of the Russian Federation, which had been born out of compromise but left unresolved tensions across the political spectrum.

The new text marked the culmination of a year and a half of amendments and debate, finally consolidating the left’s reformist programme into a coherent socialist–parliamentary framework.

## Background

The 2024 Constitution, adopted on Victory Day (9 May), established a federal republic with a presidential system. It was a fragile compromise:

* **The left** sought a socialist framework but conceded under internal and external pressure.
* **The right** pushed for a strong post-Yeltsin style presidency.
* **The far right** was ignored, seeking an authoritarian or even monarchist model.
* **Liberals** supported it reluctantly, dissatisfied with the final muddled product.

Throughout 2024–25, the Social Democrats and Communists amended the text to strip away presidential powers, strengthen parliament, and simplify the federation. But by mid-2025, it became clear that only a new constitution could realise a consistent socialist–democratic order.

## Key Provisions

### System of Government

* **Parliamentary republic**: Executive authority is vested in the **Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Premier)**, elected by the Supreme Soviet.
* **Collective head of state**: The office of President was abolished. In its place, a **Presidium**, elected by great electors (mayors, governors, republican presidents), acts as a collective arbiter and symbolic representation of the state.

### Federal Structure

* Russia remains a **federal union**, but streamlined:

  * **Republics** retain constitutions, official languages, and cultural autonomy.
  * All other units are **oblasts**, with limited autonomy.

### Economic & Social Principles

* The Constitution enshrines the **right to work, to unionise, and to strike**, while affirming that private business is legitimate only insofar as it serves the advancement of society.
* Socialist commitments are balanced with market flexibility, allowing room for social-democratic compromise.

### Rights

* **Civil rights**: Freedom of expression, opinion, assembly.
* **Secularism**: The state recognises no religion (*laïcité*).
* **Social rights**: Guarantees of universal education, healthcare, housing, and pensions.
* **Equality before the law**: Legal discrimination is constitutionally impossible; no law may privilege or disadvantage any group.

### Foreign Policy

* The Constitution affirms that **international treaties supersede national law**, embedding the RSFSR into supranational frameworks such as the **Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)**.

## Legacy

The September Constitution is widely viewed as the achievement of the left’s long campaign to codify Russia’s socialist turn. While debates continue over its provisions, supporters and critics alike acknowledge that it is the **first fully coherent constitutional order** since 2024, replacing compromise with a clear framework for governance.
