# 2024 Constitution of the Russian Federation

The **Constitution of the Russian Federation (2024)** was the fundamental law adopted on **9 May 2024**, marking the birth of the post-Rodina state order. Drafted by a constitutional delegation dominated by the **Rodina coalition**, it was intended as a unifying compromise following the adoption of the new republican framework. While it established the foundations of a federal parliamentary system, its ambiguous power-sharing and unsatisfactory compromises left nearly every faction dissatisfied. It remained in force for **one year and four months**, until the adoption of the **Socialist Constitution of 2025** and the proclamation of the **RSFSR**.

## Drafting and Adoption

The constitution was passed by the **Constitutional Delegation** convened in Moscow in April 2024. Its adoption on **Victory Day, 9 May 2024**, was deliberately symbolic, tying the new order to the Soviet legacy of triumph in the Great Patriotic War.

The drafting process was fraught with divisions inside the Rodina coalition. Each bloc pressed for a distinct vision of the future:

* **The left** wanted a socialist framework, with state ownership enshrined in law.
* **The right** sought a strong, Yeltsin-style presidency.
* **The far-right** pressed for authoritarian or even monarchist provisions.
* **Liberals** argued for a coherent parliamentary system with safeguards against deadlock.

The final draft tried to balance these demands, but ended up pleasing none of the factions. The far-right walked away entirely, forming the nucleus of the **Avanguard** party.

## Provisions

The constitution established a **federal republic** with a **unicameral legislature** and a mixed executive system:

* **Executive:** The **President** retained powers to appoint the Prime Minister, dissolve the Duma, and act as a political arbiter. The **Prime Minister**, however, held day-to-day executive authority.
* **Legislature:** The **State Duma** was confirmed as the sole chamber, elected by proportional representation.
* **Federalism:** The constitution preserved the complex system of oblasts, krais, and autonomous units, perpetuating the Soviet-era asymmetry.
* **Rights:** The text included equality provisions, echoing both socialist and liberal priorities.

## Amendments by the Left

Once the **Social Democrats and Communists** consolidated power in late 2024, they pushed through a series of constitutional amendments that significantly altered the balance of power:

* **Executive reform:** Presidential powers were stripped back; the Prime Minister was henceforth elected by the legislature and could themselves call snap elections.
* **Legislature:** The parliament moved from its provisional chambers into the historic **White House** in Moscow, reviving the name and form of the **Supreme Soviet**.
* **Federal structure:** The patchwork of *krai* and autonomous oblasts was abolished; all were reorganised as oblasts, with only republics retaining their autonomy.

These changes created the system that, while nominally still under the 2024 Constitution, already anticipated its replacement by a more coherent socialist order.

## Legacy

The 2024 Constitution lasted barely over a year, from **May 2024 to September 2025**, before being replaced by the **September Constitution** and the proclamation of the **RSFSR**.

It is remembered primarily as a **flawed compromise**: an instrument born of necessity, drafted to hold together a fracturing coalition, but which ultimately accelerated the splits it was meant to prevent. Its significance lies less in its content than in its symbolism as the first post-constitutional charter of the new Russian state and the legal bridge between the Rodina experiment and the consolidated socialist republic that followed.
