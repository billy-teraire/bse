# Xee

**Xee** (Russian: Ксие) is a Russian politician and the founding leader of the **Avanguard** party, which in 2025 rebranded as the **Liberal Democratic Patriot Party of Russia (LDPR)**. He briefly served as **Prime Minister of Russia** in 2024, during one of the most turbulent coalition periods in the Federation’s early history.

---

## Early Political Career

Xee rose to prominence in 2024 after the collapse of the **Rodina Coalition**, leading the conservative breakaway that became **Avanguard**. His movement drew support from disaffected activists and nationalists seeking a more radical alternative to parliamentary conservatism.

---

## Premiership (July–August 2024)

At the **July 2024 legislative election**, Avanguard secured about **20 % of the vote**. The outcome split the Duma almost evenly between the **KPRF–SDP alliance (\~40 %)**, **Yabloko (\~40 %)**, and Avanguard.

President **Kataroudy** (Yabloko) declined to cooperate with the communists and instead allied with Avanguard, appointing Xee as **Prime Minister on 11 July 2024**.

His government pursued policies to centralise authority and emphasise national sovereignty. Disagreements soon emerged over a Yabloko bill proposing to ban parties deemed hostile to the constitution, which Avanguard interpreted as a direct threat. On **5 August 2024**, the coalition collapsed and a vote of no confidence ended Xee’s premiership.

---

## Party Proscription and Return

After his removal, **Avanguard** was barred from contesting the **August 2024 snap election**, but Russia’s courts later overturned the ban. In the **January 2025 election**, the party surged to around **40 % support**, before falling back to about **10 %** in the **June 2025 election**.

In **September 2025**, Avanguard was rebranded as the **LDPR**, adopting a more moderate image while retaining nationalist and sovereigntist themes.

---

## Role in Pridnestrovie

Under Xee’s leadership, the LDPR gained influence in **Pridnestrovie**. In **June 2025**, party member **Joey** was elected **President of Pridnestrovie**, providing the LDPR with its first regional executive office and a foothold in the wider **CIS** framework.

---

## Legacy

Xee’s brief premiership highlighted the instability of early post-2024 coalition politics. Though short-lived, his government shaped subsequent alignments and debates around sovereignty, nationalism and the limits of parliamentary compromise. Through Avanguard and its successor LDPR, he remains a significant figure in Russia’s political landscape.
