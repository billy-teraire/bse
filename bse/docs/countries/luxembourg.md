# Luxembourg

The **Grand Duchy of Luxembourg** (Luxembourgish: *Groussherzogtum Lëtzebuerg*) is a small landlocked country in Western Europe. Though formally styled as a **Grand Duchy**, since 2023 it has effectively functioned as a **dictatorship** under **Croni**, who concentrated power in his hands while silencing parliament. Luxembourg’s foreign policy under Croni was characterised by **provocations, territorial demands, and occupations**, ultimately leading to diplomatic isolation and embargoes, notably from Russia.

---

## Geography

Luxembourg lies between **Belgium, France, and Germany**, with a largely forested and hilly landscape. Despite its small size, it has often been at the centre of regional disputes due to its strategic position.

---

## History

### Establishment (2023)

The modern Luxembourgish state was established on **12 June 2023** under **Grand Duke Ricardo**. His reign was short-lived, as on **18 July 2023** Croni took power, declaring himself Grand Duke.

### Croni’s dictatorship

By **31 May 2024**, Croni abandoned even the formalities of parliamentary rule, proclaiming himself “dictator” of Luxembourg. Under his leadership, Luxembourg pursued an increasingly aggressive foreign policy.

### Diplomatic incidents

Several incidents marked Luxembourg’s early times:

* **23 July 2023** — French citizen involvement in a raid triggered a diplomatic crisis. Luxembourg threatened war; France de-escalated by paying reparations.  
* **1 May 2024** — German flags appeared in Luxembourg City, sparking tension. The issue was resolved diplomatically within a day.  

### Annexation of eastern Liège

On the **1 June 2024**, Luxembourg issued an ultimatum to Belgium, demanding eastern Liège on the grounds of overpopulation. To the shock of observers, Belgium conceded, and Luxembourg annexed the territory on the **6 June 2024**.

### Occupation of Trier and Moselland

On **26 August 2024**, Luxembourgese forces occupied **Trier** and parts of **Moselland**. Germany demanded withdrawal, but Luxembourg produced a legal document, apparently signed by German authorities, which it claimed gave them rights to the territory. Though the document was contested, it repeatedly blunted German diplomatic pressure, and Luxembourg held the territory for over a year.

### Loss of Moselland (2025)

On **22 September 2025**, Germany launched a rapid intervention, retaking Trier and Moselland without facing resistance. This effectively ended Luxembourg’s expansionist phase and marked the first major rollback of Croni’s regime.

---

## Government and Politics

Luxembourg is formally a **Grand Duchy**, but in practice functions as an **absolute dictatorship**. Croni, who styles himself as Grand Duke and dictator, silenced parliament and governs unilaterally. His regime is marked by aggressive nationalism and disregard for democratic norms, contributing to the country’s isolation.

---

## Economy

Luxembourg uses the **Euro (€)** as its currency. Its small domestic economy has been overshadowed by political instability and its confrontational foreign policy. The annexation of eastern Liège temporarily expanded Luxembourg’s resource base, but international isolation — including embargoes from Russia — have constrained trade.

---

## International Relations

Luxembourg’s aggressive expansionism and disregard for diplomatic norms have drawn widespread criticism. Russia imposed a **full embargo** (initially targeting Germany, Switzerland, and Luxembourg in February 2025, with Austria later added) explicitly citing Luxembourg’s destabilising behaviour as justification.
