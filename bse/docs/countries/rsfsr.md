# Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic

The **Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic** (Russian: Российская Советская Федеративная Социалистическая Республика, *Rossiyskaya Sovetskaya Federativnaya Sotsialisticheskaya Respublika*, RSFSR) is the present state governing Russia since **16 September 2025**, following the adoption of the **September Constitution**. It succeeded the short-lived Russian Federation (2024–2025). The RSFSR defines itself as a **parliamentary socialist republic**, blending federal structures with socialist principles and parliamentary governance.

## Geography

The RSFSR extends across Eastern Europe and Northern Asia, sharing land borders with Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, and numerous other states. It commanded coastlines on the Arctic Ocean to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the east.
Its territory included a wide variety of landscapes, from the European plain and the Ural Mountains to the Siberian taiga and Far Eastern maritime regions. The republic retains vast natural resources, industrial heartlands in Smolensk, and strategic corridors across Siberia and the Far East.

## History

### Origins and adoption of the September Constitution (2025)

The RSFSR was proclaimed on **16 September 2025** with the adoption of a new Constitution by the **Supreme Soviet**. The change followed over a year of constitutional debates. The 2024 Constitution of the Russian Federation, a compromise born of the Rodina coalition, had failed to satisfy any major political bloc. By 2025, the left successfully pushed for a socialist-oriented replacement, achieving passage thanks to the abstention of liberal deputies.

The new constitution:

* Abolished the Presidency in favour of a **collective Presidium** elected by great electors (mayors, governors, and republic presidents).
* Transformed the state into a **parliamentary republic**, with the **Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Premier)** elected by the Supreme Soviet.
* Strengthened republican autonomy, with republics retaining their own constitutions and official languages.
* Established extensive social guarantees, including the rights to work, unionise, free healthcare, education, housing, and pensions.

### Continuity and change

The RSFSR retained much of the federal restructuring introduced in 2024, such as the abolition of *krais* and autonomous oblasts. However, it placed greater emphasis on socialist values, laicity in state affairs, and a constitutionally enshrined principle of equality before the law.

## Government and Politics

The RSFSR is governed as a **parliamentary republic**:

* **Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Premier):** Head of government, elected by the Supreme Soviet.
* **Presidium:** A collective head of state, arbitrating disputes and representing the republic in ceremonial functions.
* **Supreme Soviet:** The unicameral legislature, elected by citizens, holds primary law-making power and can dissolve itself via snap elections.
* **Federal system:** Republics enjoy cultural autonomy and may maintain their own constitutions and official languages.

---

## Economy

The RSFSR maintains a mixed system of **state-directed development** and **regulated private enterprise**. The Constitution recognises socialist principles, including the right to work and unionise, while leaving space for social-democratic and pro-business compromises.

* **Strategic sectors** (energy, heavy industry, transport) remain under public ownership.
* **Private business** is encouraged where its activity serves “the advancement of the people.”
* **Social welfare** guarantees education, healthcare, pensions, and housing for all citizens.
