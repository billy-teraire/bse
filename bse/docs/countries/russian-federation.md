# Russian Federation

The **Russian Federation** (Russian: Российская Федерация, *Rossiyskaya Federatsiya*) was the state governing Russia between **9 May 2024** and **16 September 2025**. It was established with the adoption of the 2024 Constitution, replacing the unstable transitional structures that had followed the collapse of earlier political regimes. The Federation was succeeded by the **Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR)** with the adoption of the September 2025 Constitution.

---

## Geography

The Russian Federation extended across Eastern Europe and Northern Asia, sharing land borders with Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, and numerous other states. It commanded coastlines on the Arctic Ocean to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the east.
Its territory included a wide variety of landscapes, from the European plain and the Ural Mountains to the Siberian taiga and Far Eastern maritime regions. Russia’s sheer scale and diverse environments shaped its strategic and economic position throughout the Federation’s brief existence.

## History

### Formation and the Rodina coalition (2024)

The **Russian Federation** formally came into being on **9 May 2024** with the adoption of a new constitution. Conservatives, social democrats, and independents briefly united in the **Rodina (Motherland) coalition**, pledging to rebuild the nation. Moscow was the first focus of reconstruction, its revival symbolising the ambition of a state “rising from the ashes.”

### Fracture and the rise of the Social Democrats

The Rodina coalition soon collapsed under ideological contradictions. By late 2024, the **Social Democratic Party (SDP)** had emerged as the dominant force, stabilising government and pushing a programme of assertive reform.

### The Leviy Povorot and Five-Month Industrialisation Plan

Central to this was the **Leviy Povorot** (*Left Turn*), centred on the **Five-Month Industrialisation Plan**. Smolensk became the spearhead of heavy industry, while Tver underwent deindustrialisation. Moscow saw extensive rebuilding to modernise infrastructure and symbolise resilience.

### Federal restructuring

The Federation rationalised its patchwork of subnational entities: *krais* and autonomous oblasts were abolished, leaving republics with limited autonomy. The **Jewish Autonomous Oblast** was dissolved and annexed to Khabarovsk, with officials framing the reform as one of efficiency and cohesion.

### Foreign policy evolution

Initially cautious in its outreach to Europe, the Federation refused integration with Western institutions such as **Eurorail** and the **NEEU**. By 2025, Russia had shifted decisively toward post-Soviet integration, founding the **Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)** at the Minsk Summit.

### Dissolution and succession

By summer 2025, political consensus held that the 2024 Constitution was an unsustainable compromise. On **16 September 2025**, the **September Constitution** was adopted, formally dissolving the Federation and establishing the **RSFSR** in its place.

---

## Government & Politics

The Russian Federation was a **federal republic** headed by a Prime Minister but with a powerful Presidency:

* The President could appoint the PM and dissolve the legislature.
* The **Supreme Soviet** (unicameral) was the legislative authority.
* Republics retained limited autonomy; oblasts were standardised as units.
* Coalition governments were common, though instability remained.

---

## Economy

The economy was dominated by **heavy industry**, with Smolensk as its industrial hub and Tver redirected toward light industry.
Food security was achieved through a mixed system, including Nether-sourced supplies and domestic agriculture. Infrastructure expansion, especially rail, underpinned industrialisation.

---

## Symbols

* **Flag:** Red–white–light blue tricolour, used prior to the 1993 Yeltsin coup attempt.
* **Coat of arms:** Soviet-style emblem with wheat, hammer and sickle, and a red star.
* **Anthem:** *Широка страна моя родная* (*Wide is My Motherland*).
* **Motto:** None officially adopted.
