# Pridnestrovie

The **Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic** (Pridnestrovie) is a self-proclaimed republic located on the left bank of the Dniester River. Emerging from direct Russian administration in 2025, it has since established autonomous institutions in Tiraspol and aligned itself closely with Moscow. Despite lacking broad international recognition, the republic operates with de facto independence and maintains a distinct political and cultural identity.  

## Geography
Pridnestrovie lies between the Dniester River and the border with Ukraine. The territory is predominantly flat and fertile, supporting mixed agriculture alongside light industry in urban centres such as Tiraspol and Bender. Its position along the Dniester gives it logistical importance as a corridor between Ukraine and Moldova proper.  

## History

### Russian administration (May–June 2025)
On **15 May 2025**, the **Russian Federation** assumed control over Pridnestrovie, then under uncertain jurisdiction. While the move sparked mild protest abroad, no formal retaliation followed. The territory was not incorporated into Russia but placed under direct administration from Moscow. During this period, **Tiraspol** was reconstructed as a modern administrative hub.  

### Restoration of self-rule (June 2025)
On **4 June 2025**, Moscow restored civilian self-rule to Pridnestrovie, ending direct administration. A token Russian military presence remained, but broader forces withdrew. The region was formally styled the **Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR)**.  
A linguistic dispute followed: Western states and media persisted in calling the territory *“Transnistria”*, a term rejected by both Russian and Pridnestrovian authorities in favour of the endonym **Pridnestrovie**.  

### The Joey presidency
In the republic’s first elections after the transition, **Joey**, a member of the far-right **Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR)**, was elected president. His victory reflected both Moscow’s continuing influence and local appetite for bold, populist leadership.  

Joey’s administration combined a policy of **loyalty to Moscow** with highly visible local initiatives:  
- expansion of **light industry** in Tiraspol;  
- modest **agricultural subsidies** along the Dniester;  
- construction of **housing blocs** to accommodate increased population.  

Internationally, Joey positioned Pridnestrovie as a **staunch supporter of the CIS framework**, ensuring the republic’s voice was heard despite its unrecognised status. His rhetoric, often mocking Western governments and the use of *“Transnistria”*, made him a controversial but recognisable figure in regional politics.  

## Government & Politics
Pridnestrovie is organised as a **unitary republic**, with power concentrated in the presidency and a legislature known as the **Supreme Council**. Political life is dominated by pro-Russian currents, with the LDPR-aligned presidency and allied local parties shaping policy.  

Foreign relations are conducted through close coordination with Moscow, with emphasis on participation in the **CIS**. Pridnestrovie rejects engagement with Western integration projects, maintaining a posture of solidarity with Russia and Ukraine.  

## Economy
Pridnestrovie maintains a **mixed economy** with heavy reliance on Russian support.  

- **Industry:** Local enterprises in Tiraspol focus on light manufacturing and processing.  
- **Agriculture:** The fertile lands along the Dniester provide grain and vegetables, supported by government subsidies.  
- **Infrastructure:** Reconstruction efforts under Russian administration and Joey’s presidency have modernised roads, housing blocs, and municipal facilities.  
- **Trade:** Most exports are channelled through Russian logistics corridors, limiting exposure to Western markets.  

## Symbols
- **Flag:** Horizontal tricolour with Soviet-era symbols.  
- **Coat of arms:** A hammer-and-sickle emblem framed by wheat, echoing Soviet motifs.  
- **Anthem:** Local adaptation of *“Wide is My Motherland.”*  
- **Motto:** None officially adopted.
