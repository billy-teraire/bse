# South Nether Trading Company (SNHK)

The **South Nether Trading Company** (German: *Südnether Handelskompanie*, abbreviated **SNHK**) is a Swiss-based public company specialising in the extraction and trade of **Nether products**, most prominently **Nether quartz**. Established in 2025 and headquartered in **Zurich**, it has quickly emerged as a major commercial venture in the lucrative Nether resources sector.

---

## History

SNHK was formally launched in **September 2025**, when it announced an **initial public offering (IPO)** at a price of **10 € (2 diamonds) per share**. The IPO took place in Zurich, attracting investors eager to benefit from the sustained high demand for quartz.  

The company immediately initiated a **recruitment drive**, offering salaries of **563 € (112.6 diamonds)** per month to miners willing to deliver **100 stacks of quartz**. This model aimed to secure steady supply to meet growing market demand.

---

## Operations

SNHK’s primary business is the **mining, trade, and distribution of Nether products**, with a strong emphasis on **quartz**, used in construction, decoration, and redstone-based industrial applications.  

The company maintains contracts with individual miners and teams, operating on a quota basis to guarantee reliable monthly output. It positions itself as both an employer and a trading hub, bridging extraction with high-demand markets across Europe.

---

## Market role

Quartz has consistently commanded high demand due to its versatility and scarcity outside the Nether. By specialising in this resource, SNHK has carved out a niche that promises **rapid growth and profitability**.  

The IPO in Zurich provided the company with capital for expansion, and its shares were quickly purchased by both local and international investors. Observers consider SNHK one of the most ambitious attempts to formalise Nether resource extraction into a **structured corporate model**.

---

## Governance

SNHK is incorporated as a **public company under Swiss law**. It is led by a board of directors based in Zurich, with strategic decisions driven by both profitability and expansion goals.  

The company’s governance reflects its dual orientation: providing competitive returns to shareholders while maintaining operational efficiency through direct contracts with miners.
