## Welcome
The **Great Soviet Encyclopaedia (BSE)** is the **official state encyclopaedia of the Federation**.  
It replaces the UNE Wiki and all similar projects as the **sole authoritative general reference**, providing reliable knowledge across every field — from politics and history to science, technology, and culture.  

The BSE exists not only to inform, but to ensure that **public knowledge remains accurate, coherent, and free from distortion**. It is a state guarantee of truth for citizens, students, educators, researchers, and international readers.

## Editorial Process

- **Drafts** are prepared by editors and contributors.  
- **Review** is carried out by the Ministry of Culture.  
- **Approval** is granted by ministerial order; only approved texts are authoritative.   

---

## Contributing

Citizens, scholars, and institutions may propose new articles or corrections.  
To submit a contribution, include:  

1. The **article title and section**  
2. The **proposed text or amendment**  
3. Supporting **sources** (official data, decrees, archival material, recognised publications)  

The editorial board evaluates proposals. Publication remains at the discretion of the Ministry of Culture.

## Why the BSE?

- **Comprehensive:** Covers all domains of knowledge, from astrophysics to folklore.  
- **Reliable:** Immune to misinformation and vandalism; only reviewed text is published.  
- **Accessible:** Free to consult for all.  
- **Stable:** Figures and terms are contextualised with dates to preserve accuracy over time.  

The BSE continues the Soviet encyclopaedic tradition in a modern form: a **centralised, curated knowledge system** designed for the digital age and the public good.
